## Tips, Tricks &amp; Examples for Thunderbird E-mail New Add-On Development

The goal of this repository is to provide up-to-date information and examples
in order to better "weather" to transition to Thunderbird's new extension structure.
The new paradigm follows the WebExtension standard followed by most browsers days.
Obviously Thunderbird has different requirements from a browser extension even if
Thunderbird relies and is based on Mozilla's Gecko core framework.  I will refer to
the new structure as a "MailExtension" as this seems to be where it's going.

TBD: terminology?

The approach I have taken is not so much a tutorial, but rather a set of references
including working examples, gists, wiki entries and other transition information.
Hopefully this approach will help both new and seasoned developers.  For both,
pointers to other tutorials or related documentation is also included.
