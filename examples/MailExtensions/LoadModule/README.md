## Loading JSMs in experiments

As of TB78, add-ons can no longer register `chrome://*` URLs via the `chrome.manifest`file. However, inside experiments global URLs are still needed sometimes, for example when loading JSM modules. This example shows how to get around this by either using:

* `file://*` URLs generated by `context.extension.rootURI.resolve()`
* `chrome://*`URLs registerde via `amIAddonManagerStartup.registerChrome()`
