// Register JavaScript files, which should be loaded into opened windows. The API expects two functions to exist and will call
// * onLoad(window, was AlreadyOpen) during window load
// * onUnload(window) during window unload and during add-on shutdown
// The parameter wasAlreadyOpen indicates, if the window was already open, when the add-on has been installed/loaded.
// The JavaScript file will be loaded into its own namespace/object, which has an additional extension member,
//  which gives access to the extension object
